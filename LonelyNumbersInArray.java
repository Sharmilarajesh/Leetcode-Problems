  2150. Find All Lonely Numbers in the Array

You are given an integer array nums. A number x is lonely when it appears only once, and no adjacent numbers (i.e. x + 1 and x - 1) appear in the array.

Return all lonely numbers in nums. You may return the answer in any order.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [10,6,5,8]
Output: [10,8]
Explanation: 
- 10 is a lonely number since it appears exactly once and 9 and 11 does not appear in nums.
- 8 is a lonely number since it appears exactly once and 7 and 9 does not appear in nums.
- 5 is not a lonely number since 6 appears in nums and vice versa.
Hence, the lonely numbers in nums are [10, 8].
Note that [8, 10] may also be returned.
Example 2:

Input: nums = [1,3,5,3]
Output: [1,5]
Explanation: 
- 1 is a lonely number since it appears exactly once and 0 and 2 does not appear in nums.
- 5 is a lonely number since it appears exactly once and 4 and 6 does not appear in nums.
- 3 is not a lonely number since it appears twice.
Hence, the lonely numbers in nums are [1, 5].
Note that [5, 1] may also be returned.
